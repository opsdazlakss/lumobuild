## 📐 Project Abstract & Motivation

Lumo is a cross-platform communication system developed entirely as a **personal hobby project**.

As a **Mechanical Engineer**, my primary professional focus is on physical systems and mechanics. However, I believe that problem-solving principles are universal. I undertook this project to explore how the logic we use in designing mechanical systems—modularity, flow control, and load balance—applies to the digital world.

This project is **not** a career pivot; rather, it is a demonstration of **multidisciplinary versatility**. It shows that an engineer with a strong analytical background can adapt to and master modern digital tools to build functional, complex systems from scratch.

## ⚙️ System Overview

The application functions as a decentralized-serverless hybrid model, mirroring the efficiency of well-tuned mechanical assemblies.

### 1. **Infrastructure & Logic**
*   **Database (Firestore):** Selected for its flexible structure, similar to modular design in manufacturing.
*   **Security (RBAC):** Implemented strict access controls (Admin/Moderator/User) akin to safety protocols in industrial machinery.
*   **Synchronization:** Real-time listeners ensure all clients operate in lock-step, just like synchronized gears.

### 2. **Client-Side Structure**
*   **React 18:** Used for its component-based architecture, allowing for "part-swapping" and ease of maintenance.
*   **Optimized Rendering:** Focused on efficiency and minimizing waste (latency/memory), a core tenant of engineering processing.

### 3. **Communication Protocols**
*   **WebRTC & PeerJS:** Establishes direct Peer-to-Peer connections for voice/video, reducing central server load—efficient energy distribution.
*   **Cross-Platform Wrappers:** Electron (Windows) and Capacitor (Android) allow the system to operate in multiple environments without redesigning the core "engine."

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

I utilized modern web technologies to build this system:

| Component | Technology | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Runtime** | **React (Vite)** | High performance and modularity. |
| **Native Wrappers** | **Electron & Capacitor** | Efficiency: Write once, run everywhere. |
| **Backend Service** | **Firebase** | Reliable infrastructure managed by Google. |
| **P2P Protocol** | **WebRTC** | Rapid data transmission. |
| **Styling** | **Tailwind CSS** | Structured design tokens. |

## �‍💻 Developer Note

This project was built during my free time to challenge my own logic capabilities. It stands as proof that the analytical mindset of a **Mechanical Engineer** is not limited to physical matter but extends effectively into algorithmic thinking and software architecture.
